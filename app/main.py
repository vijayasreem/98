Solution:

Fast API:

The API should provide the following endpoints:

1. Indexing endpoint:
This endpoint should allow developers to index data in a search engine or database. It should accept a JSON body with the data to be indexed and return a response indicating whether the indexing process was successful or not.

2. Automation endpoint:
This endpoint should allow developers to automate the indexing process. It should accept a JSON body with details about the automation, such as what data to index and when to index it, and return a response indicating whether the automation was successful or not.

3. Search endpoint:
This endpoint should allow developers to execute search queries against the index. It should accept a JSON body with the search query and return a response containing the results of the query.

4. Update endpoint:
This endpoint should allow developers to update the search index. It should accept a JSON body with details about the updates and return a response indicating whether the update was successful or not.
